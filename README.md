# Integration Library

## Documentation

Confluence: TBA

## General technical information

Each submodule is another client library. This is done on purpose. In the future every integration
can be used independently. Each module has its own `README.md` file with more information.
Also, each module has its own workflow in root project directory. With this, CI/CD can be done seperately for each
module.
